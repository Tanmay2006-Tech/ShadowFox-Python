for = 4        # This will give a SyntaxError because 'for' is a special word in Python
# Explanation:
# In Python, there are some words that are reserved for special use (like 'for', 'if', 'while', etc.)
# These words are called **keywords** and we can't use them as variable names.

# Let's now use a proper variable name instead
for_variable = 4  # This is allowed because 'for_variable' is not a keyword
print("Value stored in for_variable is:", for_variable)
